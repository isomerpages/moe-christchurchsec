#### 1. What time does school start and end?

Morning assembly starts at 7.30am. However we strongly encourage students to arrive before 7.20am for a time of silent reading.

As part of our 4+1 curriculum , we will have the bulk of our academic curriculum from Mon to Thu and our non-academic curriculum e.g. CCAs and CCE lessons on Fri.  School will end by 4 pm from Mon â€“ Thu and by 12.40pm on Fri.

#### 2. What does it mean to be a mission school? Must students be Christians in order to apply?
CHR welcomes all students regardless of ethnicity or religious beliefs. We have daily morning reflections which emphasize the character development of our students based on sound values that  can be applied to all, regardless of ethnicity or religion.
