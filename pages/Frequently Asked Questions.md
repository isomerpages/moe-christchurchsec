#### 1. What time does school start / end?

Morning assembly starts at 7.30am. However we strongly encourage students to arrive before 7.20am for a time of silent reading.

As part of our 4+1 curriculum , we will have the bulk of our academic curriculum from Mon to Thu and our non-academic curriculum e.g. CCAs and CCE lessons on Fri.  School will end by 4 pm from Mon â€“ Thu and by 12.40pm on Fri.
