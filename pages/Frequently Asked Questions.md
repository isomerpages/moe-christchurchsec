#### 1. What time does school start and end?

Morning assembly starts at 7.30am. However we strongly encourage students to arrive before 7.20am for a time of silent reading.

As part of our 4+1 curriculum , we will have the bulk of our academic curriculum from Mon to Thu and our non-academic curriculum e.g. CCAs and CCE lessons on Fri.  School will end by 4 pm from Mon – Thu and by 12.40pm on Fri.

#### 2. What does it mean to be a mission school? Must students be Christians in order to apply?
CHR welcomes all students regardless of ethnicity or religious beliefs. We have daily morning reflections which emphasize the character development of our students based on sound values that  can be applied to all, regardless of ethnicity or religion.

#### 3. What are the public transport options near your school?
We have bus service 901 as well as 901M from Woodlands MRT and Interchange. Alternatively, students can take the Thomson-East Coast Line and alight at Woodlands South Station (TE3) which is right at the back gate of our school.

#### 4. What are some of the school's distinctive programmes?
The school is well-resourced with a variety of in-house adventure learning facilities. The school’s Learning for Life Programme in **Leadership through Outdoor Adventure Learning** leverages on this advantage by offering all students the experience of outdoor living in a community, drawing our students out of their comfort zones and helping them discover their potential to overcome their fears and limitations.

Students are also provided with the opportunity to apply design thinking and knowledge learnt across disciplines to solve authentic problems  in collaboration with Woodlands Health Campus (WHC) through the **Applied Learning Programme in Health Sciences**. In the Lower Secondary years, the CHRian school experience focuses on encouraging self-awareness and personal leadership in the various arenas of students’ lives. 

Students also use **E-Colors** as a self-discovery tool to help them take ownership of their character and leadership development., through knowing self and others better.

Introduced in 2010, Christ Church Secondary School’s **‘4+1’ curriculum** week reflects our emphasis on the holistic development of students through striking a healthy balance between students’ academic and co-curricular pursuits.

As our students progress to Upper Secondary, they are given opportunities to challenge themselves and strive towards building their dreams and contributing their best in all that they do. The school has talent development programmes for high achievers, preparing them for a variety of national and regional academic competitions.
