**PARENT SUPPORT GROUP**

Christ Church Secondary School Parent Support Group (CHR PSG) was set up in 2002. It was initiated by the school’s pastor, Revd John Sim. As we entered into our 10th year and beyond, our hope is for more parents to join us in our vision of a close partnership between Christ Church and parents to bring out the best in the students. As PSG members, we feel it is a privilege and enriching experience to serve the school.  
  
**Our Vision:**  
A close partnership between school and parents to bring out the best in the students.  
  
**Our Mission:**  
To develop and promote a cooperative committed and understanding culture with staff, parents and students linking and communicating together.  
  
**Our Objectives:**  

*   To establish a close partnership between parents, students and the school.
*   To keep parents informed of developments in the school.
*   To promote networking and fellowship within and between parents and the Principal and teachers.
*   To support the school in its policies and activities by providing constructive feedback and recommendations.

  
**Connect U, Connect All**  
We aim to have all parents, teachers and students CONNECTED through us and by us demonstrating Respect, Integrity, Care, Perseverance and Forward Looking with HOPE.
