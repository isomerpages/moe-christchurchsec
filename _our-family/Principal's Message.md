Dear CHRians,

During the December holidays, I went skiing in Japan. One of the slopes I encountered was called Yotei Sunset (pictured below), which is 29&deg; at its steepest. Feeling overwhelmed by the gradient, I stopped at the top of the slope, and noticed that several other skiers had done the same. I imagine they might have been questioning their life choices, evaluating their chances of survival, seeing their lives flash before their eyes, praying like they had never prayed before, or some combination of the above.

As for me, two contradictory thoughts were alternating in my mind: ![](/images/P%20Message.png)

targets. If you are humble, teachable, and willing to do your best, you will have lots of support in CHR – so just go for it!

In addition, when you are trying to grow and develop yourself, don’t overthink how you look to others and what they may be saying about you. Fumbling in front of others may be embarrassing, but in such situations, being thick skinned isn’t a bad thing!

In 2023, my hope for all CHRians is that you will have the courage and curiosity to embrace new challenges, because that’s when you will grow the most.

Mr Tay
