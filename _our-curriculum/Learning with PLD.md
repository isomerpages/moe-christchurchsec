Your child will be using the PLD for both in-class and out-of-class learning. This will prepare them for a technology-driven world.

Watch the video below to hear what the experience was like for other parents.

Device Management Application (DMA)
------------------------

For in-school use of the PLD, the following DMA settings will be in place as a default:

1. MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out social media sites, pornography, gambling, extremist and violence-related sites
2.  PLD usage time will be set to 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
3.   The school will determine the applications and programmes to be installed to support teaching and learning
4.   A parent/guardian account will be enabled to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities and partner the school to ensure his/her cyber well-being
    
      
    

DMA After-School Options
------------------------

  

There are three DMA options, each providing parents with different levels of restrictions, control and monitoring after school hours:
  

1. **Default setting:** School and after school hours settings are similar

2. **Option A:** Parents can modify DMA settings after school hours

3. **Option B:** Parents can disable the DMA after school hours

  
More details on the three DMA options can be found under “**Other Resources**”.

Should you wish to change your child’s / ward’s DMA After-School options, you can submit the request via the link previously sent in PG.
