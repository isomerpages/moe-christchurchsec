**Vision:**  
To develop pupils from Christ Church Secondary into persons imbued with the necessary skills, knowledge and values that may be acquired from the study of Humanities.  
  

Through our passion for the Humanities, we strive to inspire our students to recognise their roles as ‘global’ citizens who contribute to society and the environment.

**Approach:**

The Humanities Programme adopts current learner-centred pedagogies that equip our students with 21st Century competencies. Inquiry-Based Learning strategies spark curiosity and nurture self-directed learners with strong critical and analytical skills. Students learn experientially through Class-based Inquiry, History Learning Journeys and Geographical Investigations. 

A key feature of the Humanities education in Christ Church Sec School is the emphasis on outdoor and experiential learning. Students take up the role of young investigators and engage their senses to explore various topics in History and Geography.

To bring to life the knowledge learnt in the classroom, classes are bought out to the field as part of our school’s Experiential Learning Programme (ELP). This programme seeks to allow the students to connect the knowledge and skills they have learnt in the classroom to the real world. This aspect is also part of our inquiry approach to the Humanities.

**Department Key Programmes:**

**_Secondary 1: Geographical Investigation (GI) in a Tropical Rainforest and Historical Investigation (HI) at the Singapore River Trail_**

The GI for Secondary 1 Geography students seeks to expose them to features of the secondary tropical rainforest in a selected Tropical Rainforest in Singapore, as such the Botanic Gardens. Students are equipped with the appropriate equipment and training to aid them in applying the knowledge that they have learnt in the Sec 1 Geography syllabus. 

In the Historical Investigation (HI) for Secondary 1 History, students will be tasked to go to the area around the Singapore River to collect information at historical sites pertaining to a given focus question which is relevant to their current History syllabus. Based on such information gathered and working in groups, students will be tasked to come to a consensus and conclusion. 

***Secondary 2: Geographical Investigation (GI) on Housing and Historical Investigation (HI) based on the theme of ‘change and continuity’***

Housing is a challenging and complex issue faced by many cities today. Though Singapore does not face the problem of widespread housing shortages, it is critical that Singapore provides inclusive housing for its people. In this GI, students learn how cities have adopted different strategies to manage housing issues. In this investigation, students were tasked to carry out fieldwork in and around the immediate vicinity of Vista Point Neighbourhood Centre, through the conduct of questionnaire surveys and annotated photography in order to assess the extent to which the Neighbourhood Centre meets the needs of residents who live around it. 

History students will also conduct a historical investigation based on the theme of ‘change and continuity’ in which they will be tasked to discuss how the housing estate they are living in has progressed over the years while other parts continue to be present and thus provide a sense of continuity. Armed with such information, the students will work in groups to present their findings and reflections.    

  

***Secondary 3: Weather Trail (GE) and Model Parliament Sitting (SS)***

In this programme, Sec 3 Geography students will use various equipment to research the impact of various types of land cover on weather conditions.  Students are equipped with the appropriate equipment and training to aid them in applying the knowledge that they have learnt in the Sec 3 Geography syllabus. 

This programme seeks to stimulate Secondary 3 students' interest in real-world social issues so that they see the relevance of Social Studies in their daily lives. The programme develops students' critical and inventive thinking and increases their awareness of the various perspectives of a given issue as they take on the assigned roles of the different stakeholders. Selected student leaders from each class will be identified for a trip to Parliament House to observe how an actual sitting of Parliament is conducted. This will help these leaders understand the necessary protocol for the discussion of national matters and prepare them to conduct the Model Parliament Sitting (MPS) in school. During this MPS in school, students take on a role and work collaboratively to research on a current issue faced by Singapore to form a decision. They work with other groups to discuss problems that may arise from the decisions that each group wants to make. At the end of the session, students will vote for the best decision they think Singapore should make. Through public role play, cooperative learning, and debate, the MPS instils confidence in the students’ ability to research, to write a coherent, convincing piece of argument and to present these ideas in a public speech in front of their peers. Students will also be exposed to the decision-making process taken by the Singapore government and experience the ideas of trade-offs and calculated risks in making a decision for the good of society.

  

***Secondary 4: Tourism Trail (GE) and CBD (SS/HI) Trail***

This learning journey is embarked on by our Secondary 4 students to expose them to an exploration of the reasons for tourism growth. The site chosen for this activity ranges from cultural sites such as Chinatown, Little India and Kampong Glam to recreational sites such as One Fullerton and Gardens by the Bay. Students are equipped with the appropriate equipment and training to aid them in applying the knowledge that they have learnt according to the current Geography syllabus. 

The learning journey for the Secondary 4 classes was created to allow the students to better understand the issue of Globalisation and its impact on Singapore that they have studied in Social Studies. The students explore the mutually beneficial relationship between the suppliers, producers and consumers of the multinational cafe chain by visiting one of the store and interacting with the managers. 

Finally, History students will demonstrate the historical concept of change and continuity by studying the development of the Singapore River over the years and its importance to Singapore’s political emergence, economic development and social relevance. The site covers the Singapore River, the Esplanade and the Gardens by the Bay.
