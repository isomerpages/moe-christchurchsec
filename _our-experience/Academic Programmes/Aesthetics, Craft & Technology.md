<h4>Design &amp; Technology</h4>
<p>The Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) programme at CHR inspires students
to think creatively and critically through hands-on learning experiences.
Anchored in design thinking, the programme encourages students to be inventive
problem-solvers who apply their knowledge to real-world contexts. As part
of the curriculum, students embark on learning journeys such as the visit
to Bird Paradise, where they draw inspiration to enhance their design projects.
The programme also celebrates students’ achievements through the Design
&amp; Technology Awards 2025, recognising outstanding works in Aesthetics,
Innovative, and Adaptive Design.</p>
