to question, investigate, and analyse the world around them. Our curricular
goals are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide strong science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue
STEM for future learning and work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p>Our Experiential Learning Programme (ELP) aims to expose students to authentic
applications of Science in meaningful aspects of their lives. In developing
skill sets in the Ways of Thinking and Doing in Science, students also
get instilled with the joy of learning and the spirit of active learning
so that they better appreciate the ubiquitous nature of Science.</p>
<p>Our Secondary One students have the opportunity to visit the Science Centre
in a programme where they discover how industries use the disciplines in
Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) and problem solving
processes to develop solutions for everyday issues. ‘Marvel in Science’
provides our Secondary Two students the platform to debunk certain scientific
myths that are found in their everyday lives and in popular culture. In
this game-based programme, students will learn and apply Science to various
scenarios in today’s popular culture and build foundational skills critically
to discern fact from fiction.</p>
<h3>Stretch Programmes</h3>
<p>Students who show passion and potential in Science will be provided with
opportunities to participate in fairs and competitions. These programmes
are designed to challenge students to go beyond their current level of
academic performance by exposing them to more advanced learning opportunities.
Other than preparing students for the rigours of higher education, stretch
programmes offered by our department aim to develop research, critical
thinking skills and analytical skills, as well as strengthen the students’
confidence. Students will gain valuable insights into their own learning
abilities, allowing them to adjust their approach to learning in a fun
and innovative manner.</p>
<p>The annual International Elementz Fair, organised by Anderson Serangoon
Junior College, aims to encourage students to venture into the world of
research and discovery. It is a platform for Upper Secondary students to
showcase their primary and secondary scientific research, and develop prototypes
that can contribute to the betterment of society. Students are exposed
to real world issues that challenge them to think critically for solutions
based on scientific knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>The IgnITE Skills Challenge is an annual competition that introduces technical
skills and showcases a deeper understanding of courses offered by the Institutes
of Technical Education (ITEs). Challenges are designed to be engaging and
fun to make learning enjoyable and memorable. Students also learn new skills
and gain insights into future career choices through workshops that are
organised in collaborative and competitive settings.</p>
