<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<p>The department's approach centres on 21st Century Competencies, where
students are equipped with critical and analytical skills that are nurtured
through inquiry-based learning strategies. The department's pedagogies
foster self-directed learners who are curious and passionate about the
Humanities. Students learn through various experiential learning methods,
such as Class-based Inquiry, Learning Journeys as well as Historical and
Geographical Investigations. The department also leverages technology to
bring the world into the classroom, thus enhancing students' learning experiences.
<br>
</p>
<p>The department's emphasis on outdoor and experiential learning is a unique
feature of the Humanities education at Christ Church Secondary School.
Students are encouraged to take up the role of young investigators and
engage their senses to explore various topics in History and Geography.
The Humanities Experiential Learning Programme (HELP) allows students to
connect the knowledge and skills they have acquired in the classroom to
the real world. As part of the department's inquiry approach to the Humanities,
students learn by doing, seeing, and experiencing.</p>

<h3>Stretch Programmes</h3>
<p>The Humanities department offers a range of activities to engage students
beyond the syllabus and help them develop skills in research, writing,
and public speaking. Besides developing such valuable skills and knowledge,
these meaningful learning experiences can serve them well in their academic
and professional pursuits. An example is the Model Parliament Sitting (MPS),
a valuable programme that can help students develop critical thinking,
analytical skills, and the ability to present their ideas convincingly.
It starts with a trip to Parliament House, where students gain firsthand
experience of the workings of the government and understand the protocol
involved in discussing national matters. Another example is the Model United
Nations Conference, which aims to generate engaging and insightful discussions
among students from different schools on a wide range of issues, modelled
after the UN conferences.</p>
<p>On their return, these students then lead their classmates in public role
play, cooperative learning, and debate, which are effective teaching methods
that can enhance students' confidence in expressing their thoughts and
opinions. In addition, these programmes can also help students understand
the decision-making process taken by governments and the importance of
trade-offs and calculated risks in making decisions for the good of society.
This can help students appreciate the complexity of governance and the
challenges involved in balancing competing interests and priorities.</p>
