**Key Programmes**


**Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight programme**

The Mother Tongue Fortnight programme aims to provide platforms for students to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as 'a living language'. The students get to speak their MTL and better understand their heritage and culture through a wide range of cultural activities organised, such as Chinese Fan painting, Batik Painting, and playing traditional musical instruments.

**Festive Celebrations**

To share the joy of cultural festivities among students from different backgrounds, the MTL department organises Chinese New Year, Hari Raya, Tamil New Year and Deepavali celebrations annually. Through these celebrations, students learn more about the different cultures, traditions and practices and join in the celebrations with their peers and teachers.

**Conversational Chinese &amp; Malay**

The Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) is an MOE-initiated programme which aims to strengthen Singapore’s multi-racial compact and enables students to learn functional Chinese or Malay Language to engage their counterparts in the region. Students learn to communicate based on daily life situations by listening and speaking in the language. They also gain a better understanding of Chinese or Malay culture.

**Stretch Programmes** 

The MTL department aims to promote MTL usage and learning outside the classrooms by encouraging our students to participate in external competitions and seminars. Through these competitions, students can gain greater exposure and challenge themselves. With the guidance of our MTL teachers, our students have performed well in these competitions.
