<h3>Key Programmes</h3>
<h5>1. Mother Tongue Languages Fortnight programme</h5>
<p>The Mother Tongue Fortnight programme aims to provide platforms for students
to actively learn MTL and the associated culture to experience MTL as 'a
living language'. The students get to speak their MTL and better understand
their heritage and culture through a wide range of cultural activities
organised, such as Chinese Fan painting, Batik Painting, and playing traditional
musical instruments.</p>

<h5>2. Festive Celebrations</h5>
<p>To share the joy of cultural festivities among students from different
backgrounds, the MTL department organises Chinese New Year, Hari Raya,
Tamil New Year and Deepavali celebrations annually. Through these celebrations,
students learn more about the different cultures, traditions and practices

<h5>3. Conversational Chinese &amp; Malay</h5>
<p>The Conversational Chinese and Malay (CCM) is an MOE-initiated programme
which aims to strengthen Singapore’s multi-racial compact and enables students
to learn functional Chinese or Malay Language to engage their counterparts
in the region. Students learn to communicate based on daily life situations
by listening and speaking in the language. They also gain a better understanding
of Chinese or Malay culture.</p>
<h3>Stretch Programmes</h3>
<p>The MTL department aims to promote MTL usage and learning outside the
classrooms by encouraging our students to participate in external competitions
and seminars. Through these competitions, students can gain greater exposure
and challenge themselves. With the guidance of our MTL teachers, our students
have performed well in these competitions.</p>
