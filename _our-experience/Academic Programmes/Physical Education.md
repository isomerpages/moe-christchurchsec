<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>The Physical Education (PE) Department is committed to promoting the national
vision of having physically competent individuals who are active in their
daily lives. To achieve this goal, the PE programme is designed to instil
resilience and a lifelong passion for physical activity in our students.
By participating in our PE programme, our students can enjoy improved physical
and mental well-being, develop sportsmanship and teamwork, and cultivate
a lifelong passion for physical activity.</p>
<p>Some of our learning outcomes include</p>

<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>In accordance with the updated PE curriculum, we provide our students
with a diverse range of physical activities for their PE lessons. With
at least one sport from each category of net-barrier, striking-fielding,
and territorial-invasion, our students can participate in a variety of
sports, including but not limited to Badminton, Basketball, Football, Frisbee,
Handball, Softball, Swimming, and Volleyball. This approach enables our
students to experience a range of sports and develop various physical and
cognitive skills.</p>

<p><em>Sports learned and played during lessons in our school venues</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>All these sports that the students learn will culminate in Intra-Class,
Inter-Class or Inter-House Games. This promotes self-monitoring and peer-evaluation
(where appropriate) to encourage responsibility for one’s own learning,
and to support the learning of others in an authentic context. In essence,
the games played in our Inter-House Games (IHG) are runned by students
where they referee the game and organise themselves into groups for play.
Students are given choices to play the different games offered during IHG,
allowing students to show and practise explicitly values and character
taught in PE: e.g., how students behave in games, show teamwork, respect,
resilience.</p>

<p>We also provide opportunities for students to voice their opinions through
our Class X (Class Expedition). Students will use the time in PE lessons
to plan an expedition with the consideration of their peers, risk assess
independently and to be able to respond to new information, feedback, or
changing circumstances by adjusting their strategies, mindset, and actions
throughout the expedition planning process, achieving various complex skills
from the 21st century competencies.</p>
