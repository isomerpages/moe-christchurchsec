**Introduction**

In Christ Church Secondary School, there is a strong emphasis on leading self, leading others. Our student leadership programme centres on the philosophy of developing purposeful servant leaders who learn, serve, lead and inspire others through opportunities for student voice and agency. 

**Approach**

Student Leaders will be closely guided and mentored so that they develop the ability to lead the school with pride and confidence.

* Opportunity to take on leadership roles as a Student Councillor, CCA Leader, Class and Peer Support Leader.
* Opportunity to serve and lead school-wide events such as Secondary One Orientation and CCA recruitment fair, Inter-House Games, Teachers’ Day etc.
* Opportunity to extend the CHR warmth as a host and ambassador to visitors during Open House, school exchanges and Outreach events.

**Key Programmes**

Student Leaders’ Investiture

As an Anglican school who believes strongly in serving and growing with God as our Enabler, our student leaders are invested at the St Andrew's Cathedral by the Bishop annually as a reminder to the call to serve with purpose and honour.
