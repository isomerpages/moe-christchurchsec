**PUPIL WELL-BEING &amp; DEVELOPMENTAL DISCIPLINE DEPARTMENT**  

The work of the Pupil Well-Being and Developmental Discipline Department (PWDD) is the backbone of what we do to develop the character of all ChRians. We aim to develop pupils who are able to demonstrate the 5 school values (Responsibility, Integrity, Care, Perseverance, Forward-looking) and our school’s basic expectations of respect for people and property, good attendance and submitting work.  
  
**CHARACTER EDUCATION**  
  
The Character Education includes CCA, Character and Citizenship Education (Sexuality Education, Cyberwellness, Education &amp; Career Guidance, Values In Action) and Outdoor Education Programme. It also includes School Family Education (SFE) which is sponsored by Ministry of Social &amp; Family Development (MSF), Programme for International Students (IS) and others.  
  
Being one of the 9 schools under the Anglican Diocese, CHR also benefits from the extra provision of pastoral care of the Chaplaincy of Light of Christ Church (Woodlands). For example, the Chaplain and his team provide services through conducting some CCA, tuition, a Chapel period, and others.  
  
Everyone in school is encouraged to live godly lives and seek God for His Counsel and assistance. Any one with reservations is encouraged to discuss them with the Principal and/or the School Chaplain. We align the Character Education to the MOE framework for Social Emotional Learning to guide our pupils to develop self-awareness and self management skills to achieve personal well-being, develop social awareness and manage relationships for one’s social well-being, and make responsible decisions and act on them.  
  
**DEVELOPMENTAL DISCIPLINE**  

The school’s approach towards discipline is for every pupil to acquire self-discipline and responsible conduct so as to contribute to the overall well-being of all in the school. Every child has the right to expect a conducive teaching and learning environment. Likewise, every student has the responsibility to contribute to that environment.

All CHRians are expected to fulfil the 3 Basic Expectations:
