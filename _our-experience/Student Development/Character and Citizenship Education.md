**Introduction**

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is integral to the holistic development of our students, leading to positive life outcomes, and aims to provide an integrated approach to addressing their development of values, character, social-emotional well-being, and citizenship dispositions in a coherent and holistic way.

**Approach**

<u>Coherent Learning Experiences</u>

We leverage Student Development Experiences to guide students to develop positive character traits in an authentic setting, so that they can apply their learning to real-world situations. Our programmes are aligned to studentsâ€™ developmental milestones, to ensure continuity across levels and allow students to monitor and track their own development. 

<u>Engaging Learning Experiences</u>

We aim to grow a community of active learners by creating platforms for students to think critically, creatively and work collaboratively. We also promote student voice by providing space and opportunities for students to be heard. 

**Key Programmes**

**1. CHRversations**

CHRversations are school-wide, class-based conversations for CHRians to engage one another on contemporary issues, such as the National Budget, race relations and mental health.

**2. Education and Career Guidance (ECG)**

Through our ECG programmes, CHRians have the opportunity to explore their strengths and be equipped with the knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage.

**3. Social and Emotional Well-Being**

In our school, CHRians have the platform to reflect on their personal growth and well-being, and provide peer support for one another.

**4. National Education (NE)**

Our NE programmes on commemorative events such as Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day, provide opportunities for CHRians to grow into active citizens with a sense of belonging to Singapore.

**5. Values in Action**

The VIA programmes are designed for CHRians to increase their awareness of community issues in order to advocate for such issues and collaborate to take action to positively impact their community.
