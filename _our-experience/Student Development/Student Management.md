### Introduction

The school strongly believes that every student has the right to a conducive teaching and learning environment where they can challenge themselves to build their dreams.
 
Students learn well when there is order and discipline. The schoolâ€™s approach towards discipline is for every student to be able to lead oneself through a sense of commitment, the practice of self-discipline and personal responsibility. In doing so, each student actively contributes to the overall well-being of all staff and students in the school by understanding the needs of others.

### Approach

The school adopts a&nbsp; positive and proactive approach to instil self-discipline and good character in our students. The school uses positive discipline to educate our students on behaviours that are acceptable, and those that are not, in a way that is firm yet kind. Disciplinary measures are meted out fairly, firmly, and appropriately to help students understand that their actions have consequences. The positive and proactive approach is outlined below.
