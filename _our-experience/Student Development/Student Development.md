**Introduction**

The growth and development of our students is anchored upon their experiences in school. The Student Development Team focuses on helping students develop an appreciation for themselves and others during their Lower Secondary years. As they progress to the Upper Secondary levels, they continue to challenge themselves and strive towards achieving their dreams together. 

**Approach**

Our students experience different stages of development over their years in CHR. There is a theme for every level, which guides the design of cohort-wide programmes and milestone experiences, so that CHRians can navigate their journey with coherence and focus.

For example, as our Secondary 1 students are new to the school, transiting to secondary school life smoothly and fostering new bonds are the focus and priority for this level. Therefore, the Secondary 1’s level theme is “I See Me! I See You!”

Here are the level themes for each level: 

Sec 1: I See Me! I See You! <br>
Sec 2: I am the Architect of my Life<br>
Sec 3: I am the Agent of Change<br>
Sec 4 and 5: We can Achieve Our Dreams Together <br>

**Key Programmes**

In CHR, it is imperative to equip students with coping techniques and strategies to manage their mental well-being (e.g. ability to cope with stress, resilience), relationships and multiple influences. Our school’s approach to addressing these needs is to build strong Peer Support Relationships and Teacher-Student Relationships.

* **Peer Support Relationship and Class Identity** <br>

In CHR, the idea of being a ‘CHR family’ is very important. A family comes together to support each other. This is emphasised through many platforms and is a core consideration in our programme design. The school year begins with a student-led discussion on the class theme, motto and promise within each form class. This is for students to develop a sense of belonging to their form class and to commit to a common promise with their classmates. Through this, the students build stronger relationships with their peers and learn to accept the differences they have. The understanding of differences in communication styles and personality tendencies through E-Colors will enable students to better understand each other. The message of being there for each other is emphasised during the morning assembly programme, as well as Month @ A Glance (an end-of-the-month reflection to look back at the previous month and plan on what to do for self and others in the next month). 

**Teacher-Student Relationships**

With the diverse profile of students, CHR continues to build strong relationships with students through building trust.  Trust is built when both teachers and students understand and accept differences in communication styles with people of different personality tendencies (E-Colors) and seek to understand first before making a judgement or response. The school also sets aside time for meaningful conversations between teachers and students. These conversations are known as ‘Connecting Hearts and Thoughts’ (CHAT) sessions that take place during morning assembly every Monday and Friday.
