<h3>4+1 Curriculum</h3>
<p>Introduced in 2010, Christ Church Secondary School’s ‘4+1’ curriculum
week reflects our emphasis on the holistic development of students through
striking a healthy balance between students’ academic and co-curricular
pursuits. On Mondays to Thursdays, students can focus on their academic
areas. Friday mornings (8.30am - 11.30am) are dedicated to Co-Curricular
Activities, while the last hour of the day (11.30am - 12.30pm) is set aside
for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, chapel or assembly
programmes.</p>

<p>The 4+ 1 curriculum creates possibilities in the design of our school
experiences for students to grow as purposeful leaders through opportunities
to challenge themselves, pursue goals and contribute thoughtfully. For
example, having a common CCA day on Friday facilitates inter-CCA activities
and other collaborations between CCAs, offering more opportunities for
students to lead and interact with their schoolmates. The extended block
of time also allows CCAs to organise training sessions and other activities
at external venues, as well as longer learning journeys.</p>
<p>Both students and staff look forward to the vibrant and energetic atmosphere
in school on Fridays, with everyone donning their CCA attire and engaging
in various activities, as one community.</p>
