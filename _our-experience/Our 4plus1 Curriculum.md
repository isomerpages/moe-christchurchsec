## 4+1 Curriculum

Introduced in 2010, Christ Church Secondary School’s ‘4+1’ curriculum week reflects our emphasis on the holistic development of students through striking a healthy balance between students’ academic and co-curricular pursuits. 

On Mondays to Thursdays, students can focus on their academic areas. Friday mornings (8.30am - 11.30am) are dedicated to Co-Curricular Activities, while the last hour of the day (11.30am - 12.30pm) is set aside for Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, chapel or assembly programmes.

The 4+ 1 curriculum creates possibilities in the design of our school experiences for students to grow as purposeful leaders through opportunities to challenge themselves, pursue goals and contribute thoughtfully. For example, having a common CCA day on Friday facilitates inter-CCA activities and other collaborations between CCAs, offering more opportunities for students to lead and interact with their schoolmates. The extended block of time also allows CCAs to organise training sessions and other activities at external venues, as well as longer learning journeys. 

Both students and staff look forward to the vibrant and energetic atmosphere in school on Fridays, with everyone donning their CCA attire and engaging in various activities, as one community.

In 2022, Christ Church Secondary School will be implementing Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB).

Starting from their 2022 Secondary One cohort, form classes will comprise students from the different courses. In these mixed form classes, student will take a set of six subjects at a common level. For the remaining subjects, students in the same form class could be taking them at different levels based on their strengths and interests.

We know from our 28 pilot schools that this requires a big effort on the school's part in terms of scheduling the lessons in the timetable.

Yet this will not be the first year that Christ Church Secondary has reimagined their timetable and schooling structure. In fact, the school has had a four-day lesson week since 2010. 

On Fridays, there are no academic lessons in school. The school believes in setting aside a full day for their students to arrive refreshed, to focus on their CCAs, and on Character and Citizenship Education (CCE).

Students, and teachers, can attest to the difference it has made to holistic learning. They enjoy the dedicated time set aside for activities beyond the classroom. Students develop soft skills, positive values and greater confidence in themselves.

Their current Principal, Mr David Lau, continued this practice from his predecessor. In 2022, with Full SBB and under the leadership of their new Principal, Mr Adrian Tay, the school intends to continue to make this happen for their students.

I particularly want to highlight this example of Christ Church Secondary for a reason. They started this in 2010 not because of any directive from MOE. They started this because they have leaders on the ground with the conviction to do what they need to do to cater to the diverse interests and abilities of their students.

I hope all of us will have such aspirations to enable our students to do justice to the gifts that they have.
