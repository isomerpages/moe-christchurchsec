### Introduction

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) was introduced to Christ Church Secondary School in 2010. Aligned with NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”, the school’s NCDCC program develops our cadets to be:

- **Active Learners** - motivating cadets to acquire new knowledge and skills
- **Thoughtful Contributors** - shaping cadets into compassionate and empathetic individuals by fostering a strong sense of community
- **Have the Drive to Excel** - provide cadets with opportunities to lead, communicate and problem solve.

### Programme Overview

Through a combination of classroom-based instruction and practical activities, cadets are exposed to a wide range of topics related to emergency preparedness and management, such as simulated fire-fighting scenarios, life-saving first aid techniques and emergency preparedness. 

In addition, cadets take part in various service projects so as to develop them into socially responsible citizens who are willing to contribute to the community.

Some of the key programs are:
- **Specialised Civil Defence Courses**: NCDCC is a proficiency-based program that allows cadets to acquire and demonstrate their knowledge and skills in various areas of civil defence. Click here to view the NCDCC badge framework.

- **Precision Drill Challenge (PDC)**: The PDC is an annual competition which requires cadets to execute a complex series of movements as a squad. It instils a high level of discipline and builds resilience amongst the cadets.

- **Urban Adventure Civil Defence Skills Challenge (UACDC)**: The challenge provides cadets the opportunity to compete at a national level, test their knowledge, skills, and teamwork.
