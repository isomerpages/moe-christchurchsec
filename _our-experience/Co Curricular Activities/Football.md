<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In line with CHR school values of Courage and Compassion, the members
of CHR Football will learn about sportsmanship, teamwork and demonstrate
graciousness in victory and defeat. CHR Football aims to develop its players
in self-confidence and equip them with leadership skills so that they can
become a positive influence to others.</p>
<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<p>The CHR Football training programme aims to develop players’ physical
fitness by improving their strength, fitness and endurance level, while
also imparting strategies, tactics and individual skills in football. The
players are also monitored and mentored ‘on’ and ‘off’ the field to encourage
exemplary behaviour both during CCA and in the classroom.</p>
