### Programme Overview

The 4-year NCC programme is based on the ‘Cadet Strong’ framework, which focuses on developing a **Fit Body, Resilient Mind and Committed Heart**. The programme also inculcates the 7 core values - loyalty to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets and adventurous spirit.
