**Introduction**

The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is a military youth organisation supported by the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Education. Our mission is to nurture inspiring leaders and committed citizens through fun, adventurous and military-related activities. 

**Programme Overview**

The 4-year NCC programme is based on the ‘Cadet Strong’ framework, which focuses on developing a **Fit Body, Resilient Mind and Committed Heart**. The programme also inculcates the 7 core values - loyalty to country, uprightness, leadership, discipline, commitment and responsibility, care for fellow cadets and adventurous spirit.

Cadets undergo skills training in leadership, drills, marksmanship, fieldcraft and adventure-related areas. 

Some of the key programs are:
- Orienteering Skills
- Individual Field Craft
- SAR21 Individual Marksmanship Training and Live Range
- Sports &amp; Games

There are also further programmes that include the Precision Drill Squad, Freestyle Drill Squad and Sports &amp; Games. Selected cadets have the opportunity to participate in programmes such as the International Cadet Exchange Program (ICEP).
