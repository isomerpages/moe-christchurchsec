### Introduction

The Chinese Orchestra aims to inculcate a love for traditional Chinese music and culture among our students. As a musical ensemble, students learn about teamwork, harmony and coordination. CHR Chinese Orchestra challenges CHRians to learn the various classical instruments and make their learning meaningful when they successfully display their talent as one ensemble on various platforms. As an ensemble, students understand that they are a part of a whole in producing a pleasing harmony to the ears of the audience. The various activities in Chinese Orchestra also help students to discover their interests and talents to fuel in the students a life-long interest for music. Through our programme and activities, students will grow not only in musical skills but also in their character. 

### Programme Overview

In the Chinese Orchestra, students will have various opportunities to take part in multiple school events. Apart from taking part in Singapore Youth Festivals, our programme provides students with the opportunity to learn not only about music but also to develop social and leadership skills. The weekly training and bonding activities such as games and learning journeys inculcate the joy of learning and nurture values such as teamwork, resilience, discipline and commitment.
