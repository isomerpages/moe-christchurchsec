<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Girls’ Brigade (GB) 18th Singapore Company in Christ Church Secondary
School is a Christian-based CCA formed in 1984 with the support of Light
of Christ Church Woodlands (sponsoring church).</p>
<p>The 18th Company aims to mould and transform Girls to grow and go beyond
their potential to lead and serve others with confidence, and will continue
to guide and empower future generations of Girls to carry on this mission.</p>
<h3>Programme Overview</h3>
<p>Through our 4-year Senior Programme, our Girls are engaged in 4 different
components that aim to develop them as God-fearing, resilient individuals
and servant leaders of their communities.</p>
<p><u>Made for Adventure</u>
<br>The Made for Adventure component develops resilience and tenacity in our
girls to complete physical challenges in activities such as team sports,
dragon boating, outdoor cooking and hiking.</p>
<p><u>Made for More</u>
<br>The Made for More component focuses on the formation of personal identities
and relational life skills through discussion of topics centred around
friendship, life, relationships and self.</p>
<p><u>Made for Good Works</u>
<br>The Made for Good Works component aims to develop empathy in our girls
so that they can identify and meet needs in the world, with an attitude
of gratitude and service. Our Girls engage in service learning activities
in Grace Light Spring (GLS) Senior Activity Centre.</p>
<p><u>Made for Future</u>
<br>The Made for Future component develops courage and patience in girls as
they learn and apply new skills purposefully. Depending on the girls’ interest,
they will have the chance to pick up skills such as baking, dancing and
crocheting.</p>
<p>In addition, drill is a part of the GB curriculum. It instils discipline,
a habit of precision, unity and respect. The Girls apply what they learn
in drill when they participate in national drill competitions, National
Day parades and awards ceremonies.</p>
