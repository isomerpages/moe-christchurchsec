 **Introduction**
 
The Modern Dance Club aims to inspire students to strive for excellence in dance, to cultivate a deeper appreciation of the arts through music and movement and to encourage students’ expression through dance. Dancers build confidence, discipline and learn to work well together towards a common goal that aligns with our school’s values of developing Compassion and Curiosity. Furthermore, dance helps the dancers to develop skills that are necessary for learning such as creativity, communication, critical thinking and collaboration. Through the creative process, dancers are encouraged to use their imagination, collaborate with their peers to solve problems and discover multiple solutions to challenges. Thus, the team builds camaraderie as they work together and learn to embrace the different strengths that each dancer brings to the team. 

**Programme Overview**

The Modern Dance Club explores the various types of dance, namely, Contemporary, Hip Hop and Jazz. In addition, technical training increases flexibility. Students were able to showcase their learning by participating in the Singapore Youth Festival 2023 and participating in various internal and external programmes namely the ACE The Place National Day concert, school concerts such as National Day and Deepavali celebration and our very own school production, Passionata. Their exposure to the production allowed them to mature and bond as a team.
