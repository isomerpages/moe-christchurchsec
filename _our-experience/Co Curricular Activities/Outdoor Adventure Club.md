<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The Outdoor Adventure Club (OAC) aims to develop every member into a resilient
and confident leader using outdoor activities as the main platform. In
alignment with the schoolâ€™s values (Courage, Compassion and Curiosity),
members are often put in situations that test their limits and comfort
zones. They take <strong>Courage</strong> when faced with adversities, show <strong>Compassion</strong> to
each other and demonstrate <strong>Curiosity</strong> to seek solutions to
the challenges they face.</p>
<p>We also provide opportunities for every OAC member to take ownership of
their learning, strive for excellence, be better leaders and an inspiration
to others in and out of the CCA.</p>
<h3>Programme Overview</h3>

</li>
<li>
<p>have opportunities to exhibit their skills and team work by taking part
in orienteering races e.g. Greendale Adventure Race (GARanG) Race, National
