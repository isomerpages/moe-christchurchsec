**Introduction**

CHR Choir is a performance group for singing enthusiasts. The choir's vision is to be a caring family that perseveres through challenges, pursues goals, and serves the community. We aim to provide opportunities to discover our individual interests and distinctive talents and appreciate the culture and heritage of choristers, foster friendships, and cultivate a sense of identity and belonging through our voices and heartfelt singing for the school.

**Programme Overview**

The choir programme includes leadership training, clinician workshops, exchange programmes with other schools, choir camps for bonding and learning trips. CHR Choir stages performances such as the Youth4Climate at Botanic Gardens, Voices of Singapore Festival at CHIJMES Hall, and the Sing50 concert celebrating Singaporeâ€™s 50th Golden Jubilee. The choir was invited to perform at the 8th Kagoshima Asian Youth Arts Festival in Japan.<br><br>
Choristers are taught sight-reading, singing to the pitch, enunciation, pronunciation, and music creation, and are encouraged to appreciate music. The learning strands of the choir are presenting, responding, appreciating, and creating. Through these strands, students demonstrate and showcase their skills, think critically about artworks, relate aesthetically, affectively and cognitively to the art form, explore and experiment to express themselves.
