### Introduction

The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC), formed in 1959, is one of the longest standing uniformed youth organisations in Singapore today with a proud heritage. Through a variety of activities, the values of RISE (Resilience, Integrity, Service, and Excellence) are inculcated in our cadets. These values will enable them to develop into caring and responsible citizens with a sense of purpose to serve the community.
