### Introduction

United by the motto ‘One Band, One Sound’, the CHR Concert Band is where music, learning and joy are intertwined. Our vision is to nurture CHRians into young musicians who share a passion for music-making. CHR Concert Band provides an avenue for aspiring musicians to learn through musical exploration and gain a deeper appreciation of music. Additionally, members in the CHR Concert Band also grow as thoughtful contributors, as we emphasise the importance of ensuring the well-being of one another. 

Under the baton of our passionate Band Conductor, the main band is  equipped with musical techniques and develops confidence in putting up stellar performances. Our Junior Band Conductor provides our budding musicians with a solid foundation in music. Through these collaborative efforts, our CHR Concert Band has brought their performance standards to a whole new level. 

### Programme Overview
The CHR Concert Band performs on the school and public stage for the musical delight of audiences from all walks of life. Apart from band practices, we regularly organise bonding activities such as day camps and games. Our band programme helps cultivate a strong sense of camaraderie and ensures that we maintain a high standard of musicality through inculcating important values such as teamwork, discipline and commitment.
