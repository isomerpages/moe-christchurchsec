###### Introduction
In alignment with our school values of Courage, Compassion and Curiosity, the English Drama Club aims to develop and nurture our students to be resilient and confident. The CHR Drama Club provides a safe and supportive platform for students to explore various scenarios and perspectives through communication and performance. Through the various activities in the Drama Club, students develop confidence, communication skills to express themselves, and empathy for others.

###### Programme Overview
During their 4 - 5 years in the Drama Club, students will have various opportunities to take part in multiple school performances. Apart from drama rehearsals, training sessions consist of engaging activities to grow studentsâ€™ acting skills, improvisational techniques, body language and vocal dynamics. We also organise bonding activities and games such as Movie Day and day camps. The Drama Club experience for students is one that places emphasis on both drama skills as well as soft skills where they build character, communication skills and team work.
