##### Chromebook

As part of [NDLP](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-digital-literacy-programme-has-enabled-students-have-access-digital-devices-amid-covid-19-halimah-yacob-2457851), every student in CHR will be using a Chromebook for both in-class and out-of-class learning. This will prepare them for a technology-driven world.

  
The Chromebook is affordable and affords students the ability to acquire soft skills required for the future - digital literacies, self-directedness and discipline.

##### Device Management Application (DMA)

You child’s Chromebooks will be installed with DMA to provide a safer digital environment for learning:<br>
1.&nbsp;Web content is filtered to remove inappropriate content e.g.  pornography, gambling, extremism, violence<br>
2.&nbsp;Internet connection is set from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.<br>
3.&nbsp;Only approved applications will be installed<br>
    
There are three DMA options, each allowing parents / guardians different levels of restriction, control and monitoring after school hours e.g. amend internet connection timing, install other applications.&nbsp;

Should you wish to change your child’s / ward’s DMA After-School options, you can submit the request via [this link](https://form.gov.sg/639b30980ab349001216527e) .

More details on the three DMA options can be found under “**Other Resources**”.

For in-school use of the PLD, the following DMA settings will be in place as a default:

1. MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out social media sites, pornography, gambling, extremist and violence-related sites
2. PLD usage time will be set to 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
3. The school will determine the applications and programmes to be installed to support teaching and learning
4. A parent/guardian account will be enabled to allow you to monitor your child’s/ward’s PLD activities and partner the school to ensure his/her cyber well-being

## DMA After-School Options

There are three DMA options, each providing parents with different levels of restrictions, control and monitoring after school hours:

1.&nbsp;**Default setting:**&nbsp;School and after school hours settings are similar

2.&nbsp;**Option A:**&nbsp;Parents can modify DMA settings after school hours

3.&nbsp;**Option B:**&nbsp;Parents can disable the DMA after school hours
