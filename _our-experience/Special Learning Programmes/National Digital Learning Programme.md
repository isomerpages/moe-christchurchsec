### NDLP with Chromebooks

As part of [NDLP](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/national-digital-literacy-programme-has-enabled-students-have-access-digital-devices-amid-covid-19-halimah-yacob-2457851), every student in CHR will be using a Chromebook for both in-class and out-of-class learning. This will prepare them for a technology-driven world.

The Chromebook is affordable and affords students the ability to acquire soft skills required for the future - digital literacies, self-directedness and discipline.

### Device Management Application (DMA)

You child’s Chromebooks will be installed with DMA to provide a safer digital environment for learning:<br>
* Web content is filtered to remove inappropriate content e.g.  pornography, gambling, extremism, violence<br>
* Internet connection is set from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.<br>
* Only approved applications will be installed<br>
    
There are **three DMA options**, each allowing parents / guardians different levels of restriction, control and monitoring after school hours e.g. amend internet connection timing, install other applications. More details on the three DMA options can be found under “**Other Resources**”.


Should you wish to change your child’s / ward’s DMA After-School options, you can submit the request via [this link](https://form.gov.sg/639b30980ab349001216527e) .

### Norms and Routines at Home
In CHR, we have school routines and class routines to guide our students in the safe and appropriate use of PLDs in school.

We strongly recommend parents to spend some time to establish norms and routines for device use at home:
*   Talk about safe and appropriate use of PLDs
    
*   Set expectations and routines together
    
*   Provide an appropriate learning space
    
More information and ideas can be found in the attached **Parent Handbooks I &amp; II**.
