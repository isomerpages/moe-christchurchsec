**Introduction**

CHR’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP) is Outdoor Education. The objective of our LLP is to instil leadership qualities and develop character through Outdoor Adventure Learning. In CHR’s LLP, students develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes, and strengthen their people skills through experiential learning opportunities. They are nurtured within authentic learning environments to connect with the world outside their classroom and overcome challenges.

**Why Outdoor Education?**

Exploring the outdoors provides students with rich learning experiences beyond what they can achieve in the classroom. 

They not only get to continuously challenge themselves, but also learn to collaborate with one another to achieve their goals they set for themselves. We believe that these cumulative successes in overcoming challenges will build up students’ resilience, and in turn grow them into responsible and forward-looking lifelong learners. 

Outdoor Adventure Learning also helps students to build confidence progressively. Since each student is different and progresses at a different rate, the programme is designed to allow students to be challenged by choice, according to ability and readiness.
