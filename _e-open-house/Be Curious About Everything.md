# Be Curious About Everything

In Christ Church Secondary School, you will be a confident learner who is able to inquire and articulate your thinking confidently to others. Beyond acquiring knowledge, you will learn and apply what you have learnt to real life. 

  

**_“This was my inaugural National Schools Literature Festival (NSLF) Competition and it was a very fruitful experience. My team and I took part in the debate and it was tough. We spent time to analyse the motion in depth and chose our points carefully. On the actual day, we delivered our viewpoints and were pleased with what we achieved. I feel very proud of my team for giving our best and not giving up.”_**

**_“I learnt to manage my time more efficiently and be more self-directed in learning. Planning my time during HBL is important because I need to hand in my work on time so that I can better prepare myself for lessons the following day.”_**
