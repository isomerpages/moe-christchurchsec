<center><strong>TO GOD BE THE GLORY</strong></center>

<center>By William H.Doane & Fanny J.Crosby<br>(School Version)</center>
	
<center>To God be the glory, great things He hath done,<br>So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br>Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,<br>And opened the life gate that all may go in.</center>

<center><em>Chorus</em></center>

<center><em>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.</em></center>
	
<center>Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,<br>And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;<br>But purer, and higher, and greater will be,
<br>Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</center>

<center><em>Chorus</em></center>

<center><em>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.</em></center>

<center><em>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.</em></center>
