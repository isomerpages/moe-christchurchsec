Being one of the schools under the Anglican Diocese, CHR benefits from the extra provision of pastoral care provided by the Chaplaincy of Light of Christ Church (Woodlands). For example, the Chaplain and his team provide services through conducting some CCA, tuition, a Chapel period, and others.

Everyone in school is encouraged to live godly lives and seek God for His Counsel and assistance. Any one with reservations is encouraged to discuss them with the Principal and/or the School Chaplain.
