##### Overview
Christ Church Secondary School (CHR) is a co-educational government-aided school located in Woodlands, Singapore. CHR has a strong academic programme and places great emphasis on character development and holistic education, offering a wide range of co-curricular activities to help students develop their talents and interests.

##### Genesis
The school's history dates to 1952 when it was registered as a private school run by the Anglican Diocese in Dorset Road. It was converted to a Government-Grant-in-Aid school in 1972 and renamed Christ Church Secondary School in 1973, starting with eight Secondary One classes. In 1985, the school moved to the old premises of Victoria School at Tyrwhitt Road and has since pushed ahead to provide value-added education to its students, achieving commendable academic outcomes and improving its standing as a school that believes in holistic education driven by students' needs, talents, and abilities.

##### New Beginnings
In December 2001, a new campus in Woodlands was designated for the relocation of the school. It was officially opened by Mr S. Dhanabalan, the then-Minister for National Development. CHR continues to refine its curriculum to develop confident and well-rounded students who are prepared to face the challenges of an ever-changing society, in service to the nation. Today, CHR has a student population of over 1,100 and a teaching staff of over 80.
