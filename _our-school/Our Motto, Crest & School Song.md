##### Our School Song
**TO GOD BE THE GLORY**


*Lyrics by Fanny Jane Crosby<br>
Tune by William Howard Doane<br>
(extracted Verse 1 &amp; 3 for School Version )*


**Verse 1**<br>
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,<br>
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,<br>
Who yielded His life an atonement for sin,<br>
And opened the life gate that all may go in.

**Chorus**<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.

  

**Verse 3**<br>
Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,<br>
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;<br>
But purer, and higher, and greater will be,<br>
Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.

 
**Chorus**<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.


Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice!<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice!<br>
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,<br>
And give Him the glory, great things He hath done.
