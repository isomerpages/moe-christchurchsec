<p>Dear CHRians,</p>
<p><em>&lt;center&gt;</em>
<br><em>&lt;p&gt; “I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full.” (John 10:10b, NIV)</em> &lt;/p&gt;
<br><em>&lt;p&gt; “My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.” (John 10:10b, NLT) </em>&lt;/p&gt;
<br><em>&lt;/center&gt;</em>
</p>
<p>Jesus wants us to have abundant, overflowing lives. What would the abundant
life look like to you in 2024?</p>
<p>I don’t think Jesus was referring to abundance in material possessions
like money and the latest devices – He wasn’t a wealthy man Himself. He
also wasn’t referring to abundance in terms of popularity – He had His
fair share of detractors.</p>
<p>As we begin the year, here are three areas I wish all of us will be abundant
in.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Abundance in Relationships</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jesus taught many important lessons about how we should relate to each
other. For example:</p>
<p><em>“In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law...” (Matthew 7:12)</em> 
<br><em>“… Love your neighbour as yourself.” (Matthew 22:29)</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>The first verse (Matthew 7:12) is commonly referred to as the “Golden
Rule”. If we follow these commandments, it will go a long way in helping
us build and maintain strong relationships with our friends, schoolmates,
teachers, family members and other loved ones.</p>

<p>May we be blessed with abundance in our relationships!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Abundance in Character</strong>
</p>
<p>Years ago, soon after I had gotten my driving license, I tried parking
in a public car park for the first time. While reversing, I knew it had
gone badly when I heard a little bump. I got off, and realised I had caused
a small dent in the car parked in an adjacent lot. I panicked, and in a
moment of moral failure, I got back into my car and fled the scene. Till
now, I regret that I did not have the moral courage to leave a note with
my name and contact details, so that I could make good the damage. On reflection,
I resolved never to do something like that again.</p>
<p>This should be a familiar quote: “Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an
action, reap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap
a destiny.”</p>
<p>If I had continued not owning up to mistakes, and running away from taking
responsibility, it would have become a habit, and eventually I would have
reaped poor character. It applies to many other actions. For example, if
you tell a lie once, twice, thrice, and then over and over again, lying
would become a bad habit and that would reap dishonest character. Some
of us struggle with anger management. When we get angry, we can sometimes
lash out at those around us, even our parents. Nip your anger in the bud
before it becomes part of your character.</p>
<p>Similarly, when we think and act kindly and truthfully, that’s the kind
of person we will become. Let’s sow positive thoughts and actions this
year, and reap abundance in character.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Abundance in Growth</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>A Big Hairy Audacious Goal is a long term, compelling target that companies
and organisations set for themselves to inspire people to think big and
take action. SpaceX is a spacecraft manufacturer and its Big Hairy Audacious
Goal is to enable human exploration and settlement of Mars. Google, which
needs no introduction, wants to organise the world’s information and make
it universally accessible and useful.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Individuals can have Big Hairy Audacious Goals too – have any of you set
New Year’s resolutions?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Here’s another quotable quote: “Do one thing everyday that scares you.”
The point is to regularly do things that push you out of your comfort zone,
because that is the best way to stretch yourself and grow.</p>
<p>Listed below are some goals for you to consider:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Read up one topic or chapter ahead in a subject you want to focus more
on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete <em>x</em> books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Volunteer to be a presenter at morning assembly or an emcee at a school
event.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Form an interest group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiate a Values-in-Action project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform at Groovin’ Jamboree.</p>
