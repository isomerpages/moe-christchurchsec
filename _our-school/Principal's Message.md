<p>Principal’s Message</p>
<p>January 2025</p>
<p>Dear CHRians,</p>
<p><strong>Three Observations in Japan</strong>
</p>
<p>During the December holidays, I spent some time travelling in Japan. Here
are three observations I made there. What do these tell us about Japanese
culture and values?</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Observation #1: Rubbish bins are rare in Japan. You will hardly see any
on the streets, in shopping malls, train stations, and public toilets.
Despite this, Japan is very clean. When buying food and drinks at a market,
you are expected to stand near the stall to enjoy them, so that you can
pass your trash back to the vendor when you are done. If you happen to
have anything to throw away, like tissue paper or a food wrapper, you need
to hold on to it, or keep it in your pocket, until you are back in your
hotel. Many other big cities around the world also have few rubbish bins,
for various reasons (e.g. as a precaution against terrorism), but are not
as clean as Japanese cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observation #2: When you are travelling on a train in Japan, you will
hardly ever hear locals talking – not even on the phone. You will also
rarely hear phones ringing or notification alerts. If anyone is talking
loudly, they are likely to be foreigners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observation #3: Japan has very interesting toilet bowls. In some public
toilets, once you sit on the toilet bowl, it will automatically play music
or pleasant sounds (like the sound of a flowing stream), while you are
answering nature’s call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;Do you think there is a common thread linking these three observations?
My theory is that consideration for others is highly valued in Japan, which
explains, to some extent, all three observations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;According to this <a href="https://japan-dev.com/blog/trash-cans-in-japan" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> that addresses
the phenomenon of Japan’s “missing trash cans”, “In Japanese culture, societal
harmony is among the most highly regarded values… inconveniencing others
and disrupting societal harmony often requires an apology, even in situations
that may seem minor to an outsider… Japanese people are especially sensitive
toward public spaces and how they use them as an individual. They are aware
that the public space belongs to others just as much as themselves, and
because of this, keeping the environment clean simply becomes everyone’s
personal concern. As a result, there’s a strong cultural norm of keeping
public spaces clean and, therefore, handling your trash properly. There
may be no trash cans around, but Japanese people aren’t bothered by this,
as it’s already an established norm to carry the wrapper of your candy
bar or the plastic bottle you finished in your bag until you get home.”</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2230.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online Japan Guide</a> has
a section on Train Manners, which advises travellers: “Keep your voice
down. Talking loudly on trains is considered bad mannered and ranks highly
amongst the most annoying behaviours on trains in Japan. Don’t talk on
the phone… Set your phone to silent mode. Set the volume of your headphones
low.”</p>
<p>Similarly, musical toilet bowls masks the sounds of people relieving themselves,
making the experience a pleasant one for all – even for those in neighbouring
toilet cubicles!</p>
<p>I think we can learn much from the Japanese about being Thoughtful Contributors,
which is our focus for 2025. There will be many opportunities for all of
us to be Thoughtful Contributors to each other, to the school, and to our
environment.</p>
<p>Here are two basic ways I would like all CHRians to be Thoughtful Contributors,
based on Jesus’ teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Let Your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’, and Your ‘No’ be ‘No’</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“… let your ‘Yes’ be ‘Yes’, and your ‘No’, ‘No’.” (Matthew 5:37)</em>
</p>
<p>When Jesus said this, He was teaching us to be men and women of our word.
There is no need to swear in God’s name, or by heaven and earth, or on
your life. If you are trustworthy, dependable, and honour what you say,
people can just take you at your word. When you say ‘Yes’ and commit to
something, follow through on your commitment and give it your all.</p>
<p>Be wise about what you say ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ to. Say ‘Yes’ to learning, growth,
and whatever is good for others, for the school, and for the community.
Say ‘No’ to whatever is unhealthy, toxic, and hurtful to yourself and others.</p>

</p>
<p>Sometimes, saying ‘Yes’ all the time, even to good things, can lead to
burnout. Having said that, I hope that you will say ‘Yes’ to opportunities
more than you say ‘No’. Thoughtful Contributors turn up and are fully present.
Thoughtful Contributors know that they have unique strengths, gifts, and
personalities to bring to the table. When you say ‘No’, not only do you
lose an opportunity to grow – you also lose an opportunity to contribute.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Be Trustworthy With Little Things</strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much, and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much.” (Luke 16:10)</em>
</p>
<p>Some of you hold leadership positions and responsibilities in your classes,
CCAs, and Houses, such as Peer Support Mentors, CCE Champions and keyholders.
Even if you do not hold a leadership position, I am sure you will be entrusted
with, or volunteer to take on, certain responsibilities from time to time.
Don’t look down on little things. As Thoughtful Contributors, fulfil your
responsibilities, big or small, to the best of your abilities. If you can
be trusted with little things, bigger things and bigger opportunities will
come your way.</p>

</p>
<p>In 2025, let’s all resolve to be Thoughtful Contributors who honour our
word and are trustworthy even with little things!</p>
