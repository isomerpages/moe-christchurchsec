Dear parents,

1. The 2020 N-level results will be released on Thursday, 17 December 2020, 2.00pm.

2. Arrangements have been made for school candidates to receive their results in their individual classrooms. Only school candidates collecting their results will be allowed entry into the school premises, and they are expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place. Please note that parents will not be allowed to accompany their child/ward to school to collect their results.

3. Your child should report directly to the designated classrooms between 1.15pm to 1.30pm in proper school attire (half uniform is allowed) and appropriate hairstyle.

4. If your child is unwell, on Quarantine Order, Stay-Home Notice or Leave of Absence on the day of the results release, he/she should not return to school to collect their results. Instead, your child may view his/her results online via SEABâ€™s results release system at [www.seab.gov.sg](www.seab.gov.sg) from 2.30pm on 17 December 2020. The system will be accessible from 17 to 31 December 2020.

5. The N-Level results is a major milestone for our teens. Regardless of the outcome, our teens must know that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be positive when deciding on their next steps. Continue to have open conversations with your child on his/her interests and choices and build his/her pathways together.

6. For ECG counselling services, your child may contact ECG Centre @ MOE (Grange Road) for online or phone counselling appointments between 10 to 23 December 2020 via email: [moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg](mailto:moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg), the appointment booking form: [https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre](https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre) or phone: 68311420. Alternatively, your child may reach out to the ECG Teacher I/C, Ms Wendy Chew, or their Form Teachers for advice.

We wish your child all the best in his/her N-level Results!
