Dear students and parents,

Congratulations on receiving your posting to Christ Church Secondary School (CHR)!

In light of the COVID-19 situation, students do not need to report to CHR this year after receiving their Secondary 1 Posting Results. Instead, students should refer to the school website for more information such as instructions on online purchase of books and uniforms, booklist, and the reporting details. Parents of the incoming Secondary 1 cohort who are on Parents Gateway (PG) would also receive instructions from the posted schools from the afternoon of the day the posting results are released.

For information about the Secondary One Registration 2021 in CHR, please go toÂ [http://chr.sg/S1Reg2021](http://chr.sg/S1Reg2021).  
  
Thank you.
