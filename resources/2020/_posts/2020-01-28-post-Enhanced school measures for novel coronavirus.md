Dear Parents/Guardians,

As school re-opens on 29 Jan 2020, MOE will be enhancing precautionary measures in view of the novel coronavirus situation. These include daily temperature taking and Leave of Absence for students and staff with a travel history to China.  
Please remind your child to bring his ODT (Oral Digital Thermometer) daily to school.

Let us all play our part in keeping good personal hygiene and taking social responsibility. There may be some inconveniences as preventive steps are taken, but together we can keep our children safe while minimising disruption to learning.
