In view of the novel coronavirus situation, we are taking precautionary measures to safeguard the well-being of our students. We will be withdrawing our Secondary One students from their participation for the upcoming Chingay Parade.  
  
Our Secondary One students have demonstrated enthusiasm and resilience during their practices and we are proud of their progress and growth! We will continue to provide enriching school experiences for your child as he/she journeys with us at Christ Church Secondary School.  
  
With immediate effect, all Chingay practices will be cancelled.  
  
Please note the following updates:  
  
29 Jan (Wed): Lessons will end at 3:35pm instead of 5pm. Students will have PE lessons for the last 2 periods  
30 & 31 Jan (Thurs & Fri): Lessons will be as per normal timetable  
  
Should you have any further clarifications, please contact Mr Ho Chee Hoong (HOD PE/CCA) at 6893 3297.
