<h4>What is Direct School Admission (DSA)?</h4>
<p>DSA-Sec provides a pathway for students to gain admission to secondary
schools based on their interests, aptitude, and potential, beyond their
performance at Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p>Students admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec are not allowed
to:
<br>i. Submit school choices during the Secondary 1 (S1) posting process.
<br>ii. Transfer to another school. They must commit to their chosen school
for the duration of the programme.
<br>
<br><strong>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.</strong>
