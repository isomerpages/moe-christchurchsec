# What is Direct School Admission (DSA)?

Direct School Admission for secondary schools (DSA-Sec) allows students to apply to some schools before taking the PSLE.

Students apply based on their talent in sports, CCAs and specific talent areas.

Students admitted to a secondary school through DSA-Sec are not allowed to submit school choices during the Secondary 1 posting process.

**Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.**
