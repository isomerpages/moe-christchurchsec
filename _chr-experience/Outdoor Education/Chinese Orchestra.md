Christ Church Secondary School Chinese Orchestra (CO) is a platform for students who have passion and interest in Chinese instruments to showcase their talents.
 
CHR Chinese Orchestra's motto is A.S.P.I.R.E, which stands for Attendance, Sincerity, Punctuality, Initiative, Respect and Enthusiasm. We aim to inculcate these 6 values in our members through various exposure in performances. We A.S.P.I.R.E to achieve greater success and cultivate a musical passion in our members. We work towards our goal by incorporating a wide variety of activities into our curriculum.  We aim to give back to the society with our music made with love.

Furthermore, members are encouraged to continually improve on their technique of playing the instruments so as to improve on the standard of their performances. They are encouraged to sit for the Instrumental Exams which offers a chance for them to obtain official recognition for their skills.
