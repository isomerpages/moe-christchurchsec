NPCC is a challenging and rewarding CCA which instills discipline and advocates teamwork. Through numerous activities, the cadets learn to work with one another. In addition, they will have the opportunity to hone their leadership skills and toughen themselves physically and mentally. Visits to the various police establishments, shooting of 0.22 police revolvers and adventure training camps in Pulau Ubin are but some of the fun-filled activities to break the monotony of regular weekly training.


Christ Church NPCC cadets can look forward to an overseas expedition once a year. NPCC cadets also get the opportunities to go on subsidised trips and visits to our overseas counterparts. This allows the cadets to build on their resilience, develop a global outlook and learn to collaborate with one another.
