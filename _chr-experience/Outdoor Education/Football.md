Our Football (Boys) Team took part in both ‘B’ and ’C’ Division North Zone Football Tournament in 2019 and 2020.

In 2019, the B Division boys performed commendably, qualifying for the League 3 Group Stage where they finished 3rd. In 2020, the B Division boys finished 2nd in their group for the League Qualifying round and were on their way to challenging League 2 before the season was cut short due to COVID-19.
The C Division boys did well in League 4 where they eventually finished as Quarter Finalists in 2019.

Despite the disappointment of a season cut short in 2020, the boys remain committed and are hopeful for a good season in 2021. Besides undergoing the physical, the tactical and the skill aspects of training on the field, our footballers are also exposed to sessions where discussions on values, sportsmanship  and the social aspect of the game are discussed.
