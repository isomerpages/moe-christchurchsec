The National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), having started in the year 2005, is the youngest member of the three National Uniformed Groups in Singapore. It was set up through the collaborative efforts of MOE and Ministry of Home Affairs.

NCDCC was introduced to Christ Church Secondary School in the year 2010 as a platform to nurture character and leadership development for Normal Technical students. It was offered to the class of Secondary One NT as a core CCA.  The objectives are to provide life skills such as first-aid training and fire safety, while instilling the values of a uniformed group discipline and togetherness. It is a four year character development journey for the cadets. While learning the life skills, students will also have opportunities at academic development and leadership training. The main focus is on nurturing the cadets, empowering them to be headers who are ready for service to the nation.
The team of officers heading CHR NCDCC strives to nurture and develop our young cadets into resilient and responsible citizens through innovative and challenging Civil Defence activities. These activities vary from intense simulated fire-fighting experiences to crucial life-saving first aid skills which are directly connected with emergency preparedness and management that require quick and rational thinking. They also hope to develop and mould the character of our young cadets by using NCDCC as a platform to reach out to them.

Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) camp, kayaking expeditions and adventure races are some of the annual events to develop teamwork and leadership skills in our cadets. Apart from these, learning journeys to Civil Defence Academy, Fire stations and Heritage Centre are carefully planned to tie in with the NCDCC curriculum. Participation in overseas trips organized by HQ, like Hong Kong, Perth and Malacca, has also provided much exposure for our cadets.

NCDCC has been successful in the overall development of the cadets since 2010. Initially, it was an uphill task in building the confidence and trust in the CCA to make a difference. Through sheer perseverance and with unwavering support and guidance from the school, the unit has come a long way and established itself as a core CCA for the NT students. The first few batches have successfully completed their four years with NCDCC, with some exceeding all expectations by becoming capable leaders while some have shown improvement in their confidence and interpersonal skills. Overall, the academic and character development for the classes is exemplary.  This development and success have paved the way for NCDCC to lay the foundation for character development for incoming cadets in our school.

<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Starting from 2021, NCDCC will be recruiting students from all streams! The unit has planned for more exciting and rewarding programmes in 2021 to make the NCDCC experience more rewarding. Christ Church Secondary School's NCDCC's objective is to perspire today for an inspiring tomorrow. Join us if you like to fight fire and save lives!
