*"An Infocomm Media Club, powered by IMDA."*

Infocomm Club (ICC) is formed by a group of diligent individuals, who play a distinctive role in their own ways as behind-the-scenes heroes to contribute to the school. ICC is bonded by the key skills of effective communication, listening and acceptance. ICC accepts every individual for his or her personal talents. ICC then works as one to develop one another to become more effective and adaptable and to be prepared for any unexpected situation.


With these key development skills, this helps to boost every memberâ€™s self-esteem, thus presenting themselves as young confident leaders. ICC believes that every member has his own flair, and is able to take the lead to maximise his potential. ICC brings students with different strengths and weaknesses, with a common interest in photography, programming, AV/PA and videography to come together, stay together and succeed together and learn through mistakes.

On a weekly basis, ICC members attend workshop sessions conducted by experts in the field of infocomm technology, photography, videography, etc during Friday CCA. ICC members take part in various national level competitions based on their respective talents.
