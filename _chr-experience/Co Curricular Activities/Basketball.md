Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) is an integral part of our school's curriculum. Basketball helps balance the education that the school provides for our young people. Our basketballers are wonderful students who strive hard to balance their academic pursuits and sustain their participation in CCA.

Our Basketballers are a forward-looking group of students, working and playing hard in and out of the basketball court. They are currently preparing for the National School Games and despite the long hours and tight training schedule, they make no complaints. Other than the regular training sessions, they also participated actively in the e-training sessions conducted.

In 2019, they went for a cross-culture basketball training programme in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The schoolâ€™s support and generosity gave our Basketballers a chance to see the difference in the basketball arena overseas, and an opportunity to hone their basketball skills and techniques. The players also realised the importance of team discipline and unity.

Together with the guidance of our coach, our parents and our teachers, the resilience, perseverance and sportsmanship will stand them in good stead.
