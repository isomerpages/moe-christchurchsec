Wushu, also known as Chinese martial arts, started in Christ Church Secondary School in 2008. Wushu is not only about mastering skill but it is also an aspect of traditional Chinese culture. Wushu is more and more enjoyed by the world as it helps to develop stamina and strength, flexibility, posture and level of confidence.


Our members learn routines and drills using weapons or with bare hands. There are four main weapons used in the school's Wushu team, i.e. cudgel, spear, sword (long) and broadsword (short). In the case of bare hands exercise, changquan, nanquan and taiji are some examples. Changquan is characterized by speed and vigour, nanquan is well-known to train forcefulness and strength, while taiji is noted for its slow and gentle movements.

Wushu members participate actively in school performances as well as in the National Inter-School Wushu Championship every year. Members also attend a Wushu camp in school where they learn about the importance of team spirit and simple Wushu routine choreography.
