**CF's Mission** <br>
Invade and mend broken worlds through the love of Christ

**CF's Vision** <br>
Be a place where people are inspired to be the best they can be, with God as the enabler. <br> Become people who are socially and emotionally equipped to love God, themselves and others amidst imperfections.

In Christian Fellowship (CF), our desire is for every CFer to be part of the community in Christian Fellowship as they undergo the badgework programme led by the teachers. In their 4 years in CF, students can earn 16 badges by participating actively and taking ownership of their learning.

Our badgework focuses on these five aspects:
* Knowing the Father heart of God 
* Knowing the person of Christ and the works of the Holy Spirit
* Intercessory prayer and worship
* Evangelism
* Service to the community

Students learn about the Father Heart of God through weekly life group discussions and intercessory prayers, which were crucial to discovering who they are in Christ. The teachers and pastoral team also work closely with the students to explore their God-given personality, strengths and giftings.

Evangelism is another key aspect of the Christian Fellowship badgework programme. It aims to help students be equipped with simple tools to share their love for Christ to others. 

Partnering with the elderly center, Grace Light Spring (GLS), our CFers have also been reaching out to the elderly residents and teaching them simple physiotherapy exercises to improve their well being. 

Through our curriculum and activities, we hope that every CFer will be challenged to take ownership of their own development, and emerge together as a God loving and God fearing community.
