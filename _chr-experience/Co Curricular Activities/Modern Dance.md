The Modern Dance Group participates in various competitions both in and outside of school. Students are exposed to various forms and types of dance ranging from Hip-Hop, Salsa to Ballet. Mr Derek Seong, an experienced and creative dance instructor is instrumental to the vigorous training our students receive.
