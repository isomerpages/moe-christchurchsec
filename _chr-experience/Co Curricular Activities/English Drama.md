The English Drama Club is made up of very enthusiastic and passionate members. The club provides students with the chance to hone their talents in various facets of theatre production. Students engage in backstage work and technical aspects of production from sound design, lighting to making of props. The club also provides platforms for students to dabble in script writing and stage management as well as to develop their confidence, voice projection and acting skills.

Enrichment activities such as attending local plays and performances are also conducted to cultivate and sustain a love for the arts. 

Apart from school events and SYF, the CHR Drama Club also actively participates in Drama performances for the public such as performing at public libraries around Singapore as part of How Drama's Fairytale Trail.
Theatre productions were taken from stage to video productions for National Day celebrations in school this year where students learnt a new approach to Drama and new skills during the process of video productions.
