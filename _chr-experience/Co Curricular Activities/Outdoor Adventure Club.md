**OAC Motto: Dare to Dream, Strive to Win**

The Outdoor Adventure Club (OAC) aims to develop every member into a resilient and confident leader using Outdoor as the main platform.

During their 4 years of training and learning with OAC, they will go through land and sea activities that will make them physically stronger and mentally tougher. They will walk through a phase from trainee to learner, then from learner to leader, and eventually leader to mentor.
