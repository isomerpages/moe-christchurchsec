The Christ Church Secondary School Choir was established in 2004 as a performing arts group for singing enthusiasts. Currently, the CHR Choir is under the direction and conducting of our Choral Director Mr Francis Liew. Mr Liew is an accomplished choral director, and well known to the choral and performing arts scene in Singapore.

CHR Choir has staged many public performances throughout its history. These include local as well as overseas performances, such as the Youth4Climate at Singapore Botanic Gardens in 2019, Voices of Singapore Festival at CHIJMES Hall in 2018 and 2017, the CHR Passionata I at Republic Polytechnic in 2016, the mega-scale Sing50 concert in celebration of Singapore’s 50th Golden Jubilee at the Singapore National Stadium in 2015 and Asia Arts Festival in 2014. The choir was also specially invited to perform at the 8th Kagoshima Asian Youth Arts Festival in Japan as the sole representative for Singapore in 2013.

**Choir Vision** <br>
A caring family that perseveres through challenges, pursues our ideal goals and serves the community through our voices.

On our chorister’s journey, we aim to provide our choristers with opportunities to: discover their individual interests and distinctive talents; appreciate the rich culture and diverse heritage of choristers; foster friendships amongst choristers from diverse backgrounds; and cultivate a sense of identity and belonging through our voices and heartfelt singing for the school.

**Our Choir Learning and Experiences** <br>
We hope that the CHR Choir will continue to sing from the heart and enjoy music-making so as to bring joy to those around us. As choristers we aim to:
* Develop awareness and appreciation of music in local and global cultures;   
* Develop the ability for creative expression and communication through music; and    
* Provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music.

To achieve these aims, the CHR Choir organises valuable cultural immersion and exchange visits with fellow choristers from Australia and Hong Kong. Also regular opportunities to attend unique concert performances by visiting choirs from around the world such as: the New Zealand Youth Choir, and the Hamburg Girls' Choir.
