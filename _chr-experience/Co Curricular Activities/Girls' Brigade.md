###### Introduction
The Girls’ Brigade (GB) 18th Singapore Company in Christ Church Secondary School is a Christian-based CCA formed in 1984 with the support of Light of Christ Church Woodlands (sponsoring church). 

The 18th Company aims to mould and transform Girls to grow and go beyond their potential to lead and serve others with confidence, and will continue to guide and empower future generations of Girls to carry on this mission. 


###### Programme Overview
Through our 4-year Senior Programme, our Girls are engaged in 4 different components that aim to develop them as God-fearing, resilient individuals and servant leaders of their communities.

<u>Made for Adventure</u><br>
The Made for Adventure component develops resilience and tenacity in our girls to complete physical challenges in activities such as team sports, dragon boating, outdoor cooking and hiking.
 
<u>Made for More</u><br>
The Made for More component focuses on the formation of personal identities and relational life skills through discussion of topics centred around friendship, life, relationships and self. 

<u>Made for Good Works</u><br>
The Made for Good Works component aims to develop empathy in our girls so that they can identify and meet needs in the world, with an attitude of gratitude and service. Our Girls engage in service learning activities in Grace Light Spring (GLS) Senior Activity Centre. 

<u>Made for Future</u><br>
The Made for Future component develops courage and patience in girls as they learn and apply new skills purposefully. Depending on the girls’ interest, they will have the chance to pick up skills such as baking, dancing and crocheting.  

In addition, drill is a part of the GB curriculum. It instils discipline, a habit of precision, unity and respect. The Girls apply what they learn in drill when they participate in national drill competitions, National Day parades and awards ceremonies.
