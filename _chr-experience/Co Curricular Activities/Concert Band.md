###### Introduction
United by the motto ‘One Band, One Sound’, the CHR Concert Band is where music, learning and joy are intertwined. Our vision is to nurture CHRians into young musicians who share a passion for music-making. CHR Concert Band provides an avenue for aspiring musicians to learn through musical exploration and gain a deeper appreciation of music. Additionally, members in the CHR Concert Band also grow as thoughtful contributors, as we emphasise the importance of ensuring the well-being of one another. 

Under the baton of our passionate Band Conductor, the main band is  equipped with musical techniques and develops confidence in putting up stellar performances. Our Junior Band Conductor provides our budding musicians with a solid foundation in music. Through these collaborative efforts, our CHR Concert Band has brought their performance standards to a whole new level.
